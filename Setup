##Setting up the Framework
Make sure you have a working FiveM server with QBCore installed. QBCore is a popular framework for FiveM roleplay servers.

Creating the Item List
Define a list of items that players can find along the roads and sidewalks. For simplicity, let's assume we have three items: "Cigarettes," "Money," and "Health Kits." You can expand this list as needed.

Spawning Items on Roads/Sidewalks
You'll need to create a function that spawns these items randomly along the roads and sidewalks. This function should be triggered at certain intervals or events, such as when a player joins the server or periodically as part of the gameplay loop.##
##
Here's an example function for spawning items:
'''
    function SpawnRoadItems()
        local items = {
            { name = "Cigarettes", model = "prop_cs_ciggy_01", chance = 50 },
            { name = "Money", model = "prop_cash_pile_01", chance = 30 },
            { name = "Health Kits", model = "prop_ld_health_pack", chance = 20 }
        }
    
        local roadHashes = {
            -- List of road hashes where items can spawn (adjust as needed)
            "f8208c07", -- roadhash1
            "92f0d810", -- roadhash2
            -- Add more road hashes here
        }
    
        for i = 1, 100 do -- Spawn 100 items (adjust the number as needed)
            Citizen.Wait(1000) -- Wait one second between each spawn
            local item = items[math.random(1, #items)]
            local roadHash = roadHashes[math.random(1, #roadHashes)]
            local coords = GetRandomCoordsOnRoad(roadHash)
    
            if coords then
                local object = CreateObject(GetHashKey(item.model), coords.x, coords.y, coords.z, true, true, true)
                SetEntityAsMissionEntity(object, true, true)
            end
        end
    end
    '''

Utility Functions
In the above code, we use a utility function GetRandomCoordsOnRoad to get random coordinates on a specific road hash.

(lua)
function GetRandomCoordsOnRoad(roadHash)
    local minZ, maxZ = -100.0, 100.0 -- Adjust the min and max Z values as needed
    for i = 1, 100 do -- Attempt to find a valid coordinate 100 times (adjust as needed)
        local x, y, z = table.unpack(GetEntityCoords(PlayerPedId()))
        local found, coords, heading = GetClosestRoad(x, y, z, roadHash, 1, 3)

        if found then
            local randX, randY = math.random(-50, 50) / 10.0, math.random(-50, 50) / 10.0
            local randomCoords = vector3(coords.x + randX, coords.y + randY, GetRandomFloatInRange(minZ, maxZ))
            return randomCoords
        end

        Citizen.Wait(10)
    end

    return false
end
Triggering Item Spawning
You can trigger the SpawnRoadItems() function when a player joins the server or at specific intervals using FiveM's events and/or timers.

lua
Copy code
AddEventHandler("playerSpawned", function()
    Citizen.CreateThread(function()
        Citizen.Wait(5000) -- Wait 5 seconds before spawning items (adjust as needed)

        SpawnRoadItems()
    end)
end)
Remember that this is just a basic outline to get you started. You'll need to adjust and expand the code according to your specific server setup and requirements. Also, make sure to handle despawning or removing the items after a certain time or when a player picks them up to avoid cluttering the server.
